Hi I'm Naomi :wave: I love to learn 
new skills. whether that's in video editing, motion graphics or coding skills. I'm always
looking for new ways to improve and learn.

I began my coding journey about 7 years ago when I started 
playing around with [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) for fun. 
This year however I started implementing code in my work 
projects to build an intranet site for my department. 
This then lead me to join [Code First Girls](https://codefirstgirls.com/) for my first **Kickstarter
course in Web Development** and now onto the **Software Engineering Degree** :smiley:

### My previous coding experience:

| Language   | Experience  | Length of Experience |
|------------|-------------|----------------------|
| HTML       | Intemediate | One Year             |
| CSS        | Intemediate | One Year             |
| JavaScript | Beginner    | 6 months             |
| Python     | Beginner    | 2 months             |



### Getting to know GitHub:
 - After creating my GitHub account I started in PyCharm to link my remote repository
with my local. 
 - Once creating some content I need to push this to GitHub. Starting with checking the
status I used the terminal to command git status:

 - Next step was to command git add .

 - I created a requirements.txt file by using Tools, Sync Python Requests and creating
a requirements.txt file which will list all packages or libraries needed to work on
anything for this project. Mine is currently blank.
