Hi I'm Naomi :wave: I have always been someone who loves to learn 
new skills. Whether it's learning new skills with media 
design such as animation or motion graphics or discovering
new ways to keep fit with sports and nutrition. I always
look for new ways to improve and grow.

I began my coding journey about 7 years ago when I started 
playing around with [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) for fun. 
This year however I started implementing code in my work 
projects to build an intranet site for my department. 
This then lead me to join [Code First Girls](https://codefirstgirls.com/) for my first **Kickstarter
course in Web Development** and now onto the **Software Engineering Degree** :smiley:

### My previous coding experience:



### Steps I took to complete this assignment:
 - Created my GitHub account and started a new repository called CFG-Assignments.
 - Added an Images folder to add any of the images I would like to add to the file. 
 - I dragged and dropped the images as I went along to include in the file. 
 - I created a requirements.txt file by using Tools, Sync Python Requests.
