### About Me

![profile pic](AssignmentOne/Images/linkedin%20pic.jpg)

Hi I'm Naomi. I have always been someone who loves to learn 
new skills. Whether it's learning new skills with media 
design such as animation or motion graphics or discovering
new ways to keep fit with sports and nutrition. I always
looks for new ways to improve and grow.

I began my coding journey about 7 years ago when I started 
playing around with Codecademy for fun. After taking a short
career break it wasn't till this last year that I started
implementing code in my work projects to build an intranet 
site for my department. 
This then lead me to join Code First Girls for my first Kickstarter
course in Web Development and now onto the Software Engineering Degree :smiley:

### Steps I took to complete this assignment:
 - Added an Images folder to add any of the images I would like to add to the file. 
 - I dragged and dropped the images as I went along to include in the file. 
 - I created a requirements.txt file by using Tools, Sync Python Requests.
