## Creating a database

I have created a Health and Nutrition database that a Personal Trainer would use to collate his clients information and 
track exercise, nutrition and goals.

Users can input their daily calories and meals, and record their activities ready for the personal trainer to see.

Users can also pull information that gives them stats like weekly calories, or avg time spent running in a week.
